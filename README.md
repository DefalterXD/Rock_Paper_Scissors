## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

In the beginning, I had to make the ui itself so that there would be something for the user to interact with. So UI consist of:
<ul>
  <li>Buttons to pick</li>
  <li>Score count</li>
  <li>Match result</li>
</ul>

Then in JavaScript I had to collect all the necessary elements from the DOM in order to:

<ul>
  <li>Display who won</li>
  <li>Display the current score</li> 
  <li>Display the winning inscription of one of the parties (while removing the buttons for interaction so that the score was capped up to 5)</li>
  
</ul>

## Lesson Learned:

In this project, I was able to make a new branch and using it from a 'trunk' aka main. <br>
Building a new UI for a 'gameplay'. <br>
Being more comfortable with DOM manipulation and eventListeners and using unfamiliar array methods.
