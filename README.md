# Rock_Paper_Scissors

It's a very simple game project to be more familiar with JavaScript.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript

I first built a random selection function for the computer. Then began to build a function where a round would be held between the player and the computer with all the condition for each choices: 'Rock', 'Paper' and 'Scissors'. Before this function, I already declare a variable with the prompt for the player.
After that function I start build a 'game' function where would be keeping a score. The temporary problem was with keeping a score in a function. Instead I keep a scores in a global stack intstead.
Execute all calls through a loop. And lastly, we check whether the player or the computer has won, or whether itâ€™s a draw.

## Lesson Learned:

In this project, I realized how to use a 'functions', 'conditions' and 'other methods'. Where is the scope and how to interact with it, as well as the for loop.
